# Somnia Gas Profiler - Project Summary

## Overview

This project transforms the existing Node.js CLI gas profiling tool into a Web3 dApp deployed on Somnia testnet to meet hackathon submission requirements.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Smart Contract Deployment
- Successfully deployed the AnalysisRegistry.sol contract to Somnia testnet
- Contract address: `0xc86704DC97d7154297F34B816d6643FEb3685af3`
- Verified contract functionality with test transactions
- Contract can store and retrieve gas analysis metadata on-chain

### 2. Web Frontend
- Created a modern React-based frontend with Vite
- Implemented wallet connection via MetaMask
- Designed responsive UI with gas analysis display
- Integrated Tailwind CSS for styling

### 3. Backend API
- Wrapped existing CLI functionality in Express.js API
- Created endpoints for contract analysis
- Implemented JSON response formatting

### 4. Full Integration
- Connected all components (frontend, backend, smart contract)
- Verified end-to-end functionality
- Tested on-chain data storage and retrieval

## Hackathon Requirements Met

✅ Working Web3 dApp with web interface
✅ Deployed on Somnia testnet
✅ Web3 wallet connection capability
✅ Contract address input and gas analysis display
✅ Architecture diagram showing Web3 components
✅ On-chain data storage for transparency

- Verification scripts to test contract functionality

## Next Steps

1. Create demo video showcasing the dApp functionality
2. Prepare pitch deck for presentation
3. Add user authentication via wallet
4. Implement historical analysis tracking
5. Add advanced UI/UX features

This project successfully transforms the CLI tool into a fully functional Web3 dApp that meets all hackathon requirements.
